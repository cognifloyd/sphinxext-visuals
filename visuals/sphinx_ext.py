    visual assets are externally sourced from some DAM (digital asset manager)
    or are externally generated as would be done through the visuals API.
    That lead to the following design decisions:

    This uses app.env.assets* because both app.builder.images and app.env.images:
    - are too widely used throughout sphinx to modify safely
    - deal with local image files (copy from source files to output)
    - require that the image files exist in the project's source files
    - assume that the image files are relative to the docname that includes them

    This uses AssetsDict instead of FilenameUniqDict because we don't need filenames

    Sphinx's image infrastructure also took care of:
    - select alternative image types
    - image translation
    - additional image-related post processing and transforms
    These might need to be replaced in visuals.
