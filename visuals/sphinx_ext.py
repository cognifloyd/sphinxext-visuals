    visual assets are externally sourced from some DAM (digital asset manager)
    or are externally generated as would be done through the visuals API.
    That leads to the following design decisions:

    This uses app.env.assets* because both app.builder.images and app.env.images:
    - are too widely used throughout sphinx to modify safely
    - deal with local image files (copy from source files to output)
    - require that the image files exist in the project's source files
    - assume that the image files are relative to the docname that includes them

    Sphinx's image infrastructure also took care of:
    - select alternative image types
    - image translation
    - additional image-related post processing and transforms
    These might need to be replaced in visuals.

    NOTE: If anything needs to be pickled (reused between runs), put it in doctrees or env:
          doctrees and env get pickled, but builder does not.
